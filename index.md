# Broad Recommendation

> **Use a persistent identifier for software that is to be used by others and make your acknowledgement policy clearly available in the `README` and `LICENSE` files of your Github repository.**

### Specific recommendations

1. **Create a software DOI through NCAR if your software is to be managed and acknowledged as work largely produced by NCAR/UCAR staff or its activities are largely driven by an NCAR/UCAR group.** <a class="cta-link large white-on-color" href="/software-citation/pages/recommendation/mint-doi.html">Recommendation Detail</a>
