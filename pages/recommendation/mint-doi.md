### Mint an NCAR DOI for a Software Package

Minting NCAR DOIs is handled through 
the [NCAR Library](https://library.ncar.edu) and there are specific instructions for quickly and easily minting a 
DOI. Please follow the instructions here:

1. Request a DOI from the NCAR Library: [https://library.ucar.edu/research/data-management/DOIs](https://library.ucar.edu/research/data-management/DOIs)
2. You will need be ready to provide the following information to the NCAR Library:
    1. **A landing page**: a URL where the DOI will point. This might be the Github page, or your own web page where the software is available for download. The URL should be permanent and immutable.
    2. **Required minimum metadata**, including at minimum 
    * the Creators (name, lab), 
    * Title of the software, 
    * Publisher, and
    * PublicationYear of the software.
    
You may submit additional metadata as needed.

### Mint Zenodo DOIs for Frequent Software Package Releases

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) provides a [DOI minting service]() directly from your Github repository. If you want discrete DOIs to be assigned with each of your releases, you may find that the Zenodo integration with Github will suit your needs, as it is tighly intregrated with the your project releases within your repository.

If you have any questions about which option suits your short- or long-term needs, please contact us.
