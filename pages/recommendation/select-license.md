### Select a License

Selecting a license for your software is important.  As an NSF-funded project, your software is [required to have an open source license]().  While there are a lot of licenses available to use, the most popular software licenses in use at NCAR are the [MIT License]() and [Apache License]().  We would encourage you 

If you need help choosing a license, try visiting the site [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) which maintains a simple wizard for helping end users select an open source license.  For a more comprehensive view of all licenses available (for both software or documentation) visit the SPDX Project which has a list of over 100 licenses to choose from.  Visit [https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/) for more information.
