# About these recommendations

With over 500 repositories in the NCAR Github organization repository [https://github.com/NCAR](https://github.com/NCAR), there was an obvious opportunity to understand the current landscape of open scientific software within the organization.  In the first quarter of 2020, a brief software citation survey was developed to understand the needs of scientific software producers (and consumers) at NCAR.  This site is a result of that survey which focused on questions about citation practices, persistent identifiers for software, licensing, tools and platforms supporting software archiving, among other things.  The survey provided community feedback necessary for refining the recommendations here.
